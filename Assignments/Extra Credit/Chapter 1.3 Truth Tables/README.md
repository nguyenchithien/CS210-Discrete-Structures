# Extra Credit - Truth Table Builder

This guide will step you through how to build a truth table builder
in Python.

You don't need previous Python experience, this will give you step-by-step instructions.

## Open IDLE

First, click on the Start menu and type in "Python". There should be an option that says IDLE. Select this program.

This will open the Python shell.

## Create a Python script

Within the shell, go to **File > New File**.

Save this new file on your computer somewhere (like the desktop) as "truth_table.py".

## Simple booleans

Let's start out with some simple booleans. In discrete math, we usually use *p* and *q* as the propositional variables, which will be either True or False.

In Python, you can create boolean variables like this:

```python
p = True
q = False
```
	
and you can print the values of these variables like this:

```python
print( p )
print( q )
```

Type this into your script, and go to **Run > Run Module** (or hit F5) and the program will run in the Python shell.

You can also use the keywords **and**, **or**, and **not** to combine propositions as well:

![using and and or](images/andor.png)

Source Code:

```python
p = True
q = False

print( "p is: ", p )
print( "q is: ", q )
print( "p and q: ", p and q )
print( "p or q: ", p or q )
```

Therefore, if you wanted to write out a truth table that looked like this:

<table>
<tr>
<th>p</th>
<th>q</th>
<th>p âˆ§ q</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>T</td>
<td>T</td>
<td>T</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>T</td>
<td>F</td>
<td>F</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>F</td>
<td>T</td>
<td>F</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>F</td>
<td>F</td>
<td>F</td>
</tr>
</table>

You could manually type it out in code like this:

![truth table program 1](images/manual-truth-table.png)

Source Code:

```python
p = True
q = True

print( "p \t", "q \t", "p and q" )
print( p, "\t", q, "\t", p and q )

p = True
q = False

print( p, "\t", q, "\t", p and q )

p = False
q = True

print( p, "\t", q, "\t", p and q )

p = False
q = False

print( p, "\t", q, "\t", p and q )
```


But... it would be easier to use loops!

---

## Using loops to build a truth table

Let's store all possible values for *p* and for *q* in new variables - Lists. This will look like:

```python
pValues = [ True, False ]
qValues = [ True, False ]
```

Then, we can use for loops to do T-T, T-F, F-T, and F-F automatically for us!

```python
for p in pValues:
	for q in qValues:
		print( p, "\t", q, "\t", p and q )
```

Then when the program runs it will look like this:

![truth tables with for loops](images/forloops.png)

Now, you can use this program to solve all your truth tables! You just have to update *"p and q"* to say whatever the problem you're trying to solve is.

Sometimes, you will have to build truth tables with *three* propositional variables, and you can customize the program to look like this:

![p and q and not r](images/three-variables.png)
