## Notes

Question 9

The negation of an implication is NOT AN IMPLICATION.

	¬( p → q ) ≡ p ∧ ¬q

Question 10

Phrasing isn't "If you got an extra life, then you collected 100 coins";
the cause would be "You got an extra life" and the result would be
"you got 100 coins". It isn't a simple rephrasing of the original problem.

Also, given the statement

	p: You run into a goomba
	q: You lose a life
	p → q: if you run into a goomba, then you lose a life
	
Many people got the contrapositive and inverses wrong

* Contrapositive ¬q → ¬p
	* Right: "If you do not lose a life, then you do not run into a goomba"
	* WRONG: "You won't lose a life if you don't run into a goomba"

Example

* Original: "If you collect a green mushroom, then you get an extra life."
* Contrapositive: "If you don't collect an extra life, then you don't collect a green mushroom."
* Incorrect: "If you don't get an extra life, then you *didn't* collect the green mushroom."

Predicates

Too many people tried to write statements like "x is divisible by 3" symbolically. **These are supposed to be written out in English**, such as:

	P(x) is the predicate x is divisible by 3
	
We **never covered how to write a number as divisible by 3, or even, or odd** - that is in Chapter 2. Using English to define the predicates is fine.

For reference, the definition of an even number *n* is:

	n = 2k
	
	where n and k are integers

and an odd number *m* is:

	m = 2a + 1
	
	where m and a are integers

and a number *o* that is divisible by 4:

	o = 4b
	
	where o and b are integers

Secondly, when you're using a predicate P(x) or whatever else, you **must define it**. You cannot simply state "P(x)" as the answer to a problem without specifying what P(x) is.

# Survey responses

## Day session

	Do you feel like you did well on the exam?
	* 10		Yes
	* 2			Decent, So-so
	* 1			Maybe, except for chapter 1.5
	* 1			Neutral
	
	Do you feel like you had enough resources to prepare for the exam?
	* 13		Yes
	* 1			Yes, but I didn't study enough

### Feedback

"It was okay I guess."

"Very good"

"I do well conceptually, the fact that some background information was on the test was really appreciated, after all, applying it is much more important than memorizing things I could look up."

"I believe the exam was perfectly aligned with the content so far."

"It was good and helpful"

"I like the formatting a lot!"

"It was organized and well made"

"I found having the terms and negations defined on the first page kind of defeated the point of memorizing."

"Good exam, it felt fair and it was well written."

"I wish it were more like the quizzes. The breakdown on those are wonderful. Overall, it was good."

"It was good."

"The exam was okay"

"I wish I was more prepared but overall it was good."

"Good. Needed mastery of material to know, but resources helped."

"Exam was fair, and part I failed was my own fault for not (?can't read)"

"It was fine"

"I really appreciate the front page, it reassures me I remember some of the small differences like w/ the vocab."

"Good"

"On cheat sheet include negation of implication."

"♥"

"Exam was well organized"

"Pretty good, a little tricky"

"The test felt properly balanced"

"Your exam was cute! I thought question 6 in particular was really funny and made me smile!"
