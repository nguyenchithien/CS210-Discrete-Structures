# Items from chapter 2

To do everything in Chapter 3, we need a few definitions from Chapter 2.

## Sets

**ℚ is the set of rational numbers.** In mathematics, a rational number is any number that can be expressed as the quotient or fraction p/q of two integers, a numerator p and a non-zero denominator q. ([from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number))

**ℕ is the set of natural numbers.** Generally regarded as "counting numbers"; whole, non-negative integers, such as 0, 1, 2, 3, ...

**ℝ is the set of real numbers.** In general, all numbers... except for imaginary ones (such as the square root of a negative number.)

**ℤ is the set of integers.** An integer (from the Latin integer meaning "whole")[note 1] is a number that can be written without a fractional component. ([from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer))

We can also further denote these sets, with a superset of "+" for "positive", or a superset of "≥0" for "non-negative"
