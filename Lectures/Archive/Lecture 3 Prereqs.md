# Items from chapter 2

To do everything in Chapter 3, we need a few definitions from Chapter 2.

## Mathematical writing

### The Closure property of integers

* Closure: A set has closure under an operation if performance of that operation on members of the set always produces a member of the same set ([from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(mathematics)))

When we are performing *addition*, *subtraction* or *multiplication* on some integer, then the result will also be an integer.

Note that this does not apply to division.

### Definition of an even integer

Let *n∈Z* be an integer.

Then *n* is even if and only if it has 2 as a divisor.

That is, *n *is even if and only if it is of the form *n=2r* where r∈Z is an integer.

([from proofwiki.org](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Definition:Even_Integer))

### Definition of an odd integer

Let *n∈Z* be an integer.

Definition 1

*n* is odd if and only if it is not divisible by 2.

That is, if and only if it is not even.

Definition 2

*n* is odd if and only if:

*∃m∈Z:n=2m+1*

([from proofwiki.org](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Definition:Odd_Integer))

### Definition of a divisible integer

An integer *n* is divisible by *4* if *n = 4k*, where k is some other integer. This can similarly be applied to divisibility regarding other integers.
