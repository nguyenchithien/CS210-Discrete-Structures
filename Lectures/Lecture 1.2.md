# Sequences

We will be looking at Sequences, and how to find a pattern between
sequences of numbers in order to build Closed and Recursive formulas
for them.

We will also look at building and evaluating sums using the summation notation.

## Definitions

### Closed Formula

With a closed formula, you can derive a specific element of the sequence
based on its index in the list.

Example: a<sub>n</sub> = n + 1

* a<sub>1</sub> = 1 + 1 = 2
* a<sub>2</sub> = 2 + 1 = 3
* a<sub>3</sub> = 3 + 1 = 4
* a<sub>4</sub> = 4 + 1 = 5

### Recursive Formula

With a recursive formula, you must first specify the first value of the 
list, at position 1...

* a<sub>1</sub> = 2

And then also define the formula for each subsequent number, referencing
previous elements (such as a<sub>n-1</sub>) in the formula.

Example: a<sub>1</sub> = 2; a<sub>n</sub> = a<sub>n-1</sub> + 1

* a<sub>1</sub> = 2
* a<sub>2</sub> = a<sub>1</sub> + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3
* a<sub>3</sub> = a<sub>2</sub> + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4
* a<sub>4</sub> = a<sub>3</sub> + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5
