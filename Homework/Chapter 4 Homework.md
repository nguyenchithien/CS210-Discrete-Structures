# Chapter 4 Homework

## 4.1: Definitions, Diagrams, and Inverses

Exercises 1 (a, c), 3, 4, 6, 8 (a, b, c), 10 (a, b, c)

## 4.2: The Composition Operation

Exercises 1 (a, b, c)

and

come up with two functions, f(x) and g(x). Do the following:

* Solve for f(g(x))
* Using f(x) and f(g(x)), solve for g(x)
* Using g(x) and f(g(x)), solve for f(x)

You can check your work because you should have all three functions.
